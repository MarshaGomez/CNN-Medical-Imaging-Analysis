- **Honor code**: you can consult any papers, references, or available implementations for ideas and code, but you must clearly cite your sources in your code and in your report. The information leakage between groups is not allowed: originality of the work will be taken into account in the project assessment. 

- **Collaboration**: We are students of the University of Pisa, Italy.
